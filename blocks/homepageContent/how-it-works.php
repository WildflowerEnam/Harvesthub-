    <div class="content1">
    <h3>Farmers Upload Fresh Produce</h3>
    <p>Local farmers use the HarvestHub app to list their freshly harvested goods in real time. They upload photos, set prices, and tag items as organic, seasonal, or specialty.</p>
    <blockquote>“Amina just picked fresh tomatoes—she lists them instantly for buyers nearby.”</blockquote>

    <h3>Smart Dashboard Organizes Listings</h3>
    <p>HarvestHub’s backend organizes all incoming produce by category, freshness, and location. Farmers get insights on pricing trends and demand, while buyers see what’s available near them.</p>
    <blockquote>“The dashboard helps Amina price her tomatoes competitively and track inventory.”</blockquote>

    <h3>Conscious Buyers Browse & Select</h3>
    <p>Buyers open the app, browse local farms, and select produce that aligns with their values—organic, local, sustainable. They can see who grew it, how far it traveled, and when it was picked.</p>
    <blockquote>“David chooses carrots from a farm just 12km away—fresh and eco-friendly.”</blockquote>

    <h3>Delivery in Motion</h3>
    <p>HarvestHub coordinates delivery from farm to doorstep. Produce is packed sustainably and routed efficiently to reduce waste and carbon footprint.</p>
    <blockquote>“A HarvestHub van picks up Amina’s tomatoes and delivers them to David’s kitchen.”</blockquote>

    <h3>Community Impact & Fair Trade</h3>
    <p>Farmers get paid fairly. Buyers enjoy fresh, traceable food. And the community grows stronger through transparency and trust.</p>
